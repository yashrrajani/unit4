# Unit-4-Project-OOP-Game-Show

Apart from the basic instructions on Codestrom, I was able to achieve the categories to achieve an A by enabling keyboard functionality so that the users can type out the guessed letters in addition to selecting them using the mouse. Moreover, I added a link to the main screen so that users could learn more about noteable spellers, which would take them to a Wikipedia page with a list of Scripps National Spelling Bee winners. Additionally, I added audio files to the game so that when the user selects a correct key it triggers a celebration audio, and when the user selects a wrong letter it triggers a "you're wrong" audio. Additionally, I made a resetGame function which dealt with reorganizing the game board and logistics of the game upon completion (whether successful or not). Last but certainly not least, I added two images to the game, and one of them fades into the final screen (win or lose) using animations. 

Overall, I developed a greater understanding of object oriented coding, combining my knowledge of methods and functions, dealing with multiple JS files, and personalizing a webpage. Some of the hardest parts were certainly resetting all of the components of the game board and determining the appearance of the lives based on user input. I had a lot of fun making this project!
